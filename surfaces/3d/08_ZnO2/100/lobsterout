INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 89 and upwards will be ignored.
setting up CO interactions... found 4 interactions.

WARNING: Cannot use the tetrahedron method for k-space integration and must fall
WARNING: back to Gaussian smearing which can take significantly longer. Make
WARNING: sure to use the tetrahedron method whenever applicable.
